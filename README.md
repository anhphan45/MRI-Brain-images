# MRI Brain Images Analysis


This repository features a Jupyter notebook for constructing an image classification model using the VGG-16 pre-trained model.


The MRI brain images used in this project are sourced from the [Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection) dataset on Kaggle.
